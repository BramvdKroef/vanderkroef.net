* Introduction
==============

These are the sources for building the website at
http://www.vanderkroef.net. 

* Requirements for building
===========================

To build the sources you will need the following:
 - make - to build the sources.
 - yuicompressor - for compressing the css files. You can replace this
   with another minifier that uses the format 'minifier in.css -o
   out.css'. Just run make with the argument 'CSSMINI=minifier'.
 - pdflatex - to compile the latex source for the CV.
 - Graphviz - to compile the diagrams in src/graphs/.
 - lessc - to compile .less source files to css. See http://lesscss.org
 - Emacs - including org-mode for converting the .org files to HTML.
 - Imagemagick - for scaling the menu icon source pngs and combining
   them into menu.png.

* Building
==========

In a terminal run make in the main directory. This will create the
public_html directory containing all the files that make up the
website.

After building you can upload the files in the public_html directory
to a web server.
