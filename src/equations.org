I wrote this to get a better understanding of algebra, and because I
got annoyed with how particular calculators are about entering
equations. The app takes math equations and tries to find the values
for the variables in them. For example:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
x = 10 * 5 / 2
y * y + x = 100 
z = a * 5
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+CAPTION: The results for the entered equations.
#+ATTR_HTML: alt="Screenshot of the eqations app."
[[file:images/equations1.png]]

The entered problems are parsed into a parse tree. 

The tree is then optimized by solving branches that don't have
variables in them -- e.g. replacing '1 + 1' with '2' -- and minimizing
the number of variables -- e.g. replacing 'x + x' with 'x * 2' -- to
make the next step easier.

Next, for each unknown variable a copy of the tree is reordered so
that the variable is the only thing on one side of the equation.

Example using the lines 'y = 20' and '5 * y = 50 + x * x'.

* Download
- [[https://github.com/BramvdKroef/Equations][Source on Github]]
- [[file:files/equations.jar][Compiled .jar]]

* Usage
It is written in Java so it requires a
#+BEGIN_HTML
<acronym title="Java Runtime Environment">JRE</acronym>.
#+END_HTML 
Most systems already have it installed but if you don't have it you
can get it from [[http://www.java.com][Java.com]]. 

Just download the .jar file and run it like you would any app. You can
also run it from a terminal with this command:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
java -jar equations.jar
#+END_SRC

Enter any formulas and equations in the top text box and the results
will be displayed in the bottom text box as you type.
