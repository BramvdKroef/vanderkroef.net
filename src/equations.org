I wrote this to get a better understanding of algebra, and because I
got annoyed with how particular calculators are about entering
equations. The app takes math equations and tries to find the values
for the variables in them. For example:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
x = 10 * 5 / 2
y * y + x = 100 
z = a * 5
#+END_EXAMPLE

The entered problems are parsed into a parse tree and several classes
try to reorder it to get the values for the variables they find. A
list of variables with their values is presented to the user:

#+CAPTION: The results for the entered equations.

* How To Get It
It is written in Java so it requires a
#+BEGIN_HTML
<acronym title="Java Runtime Environment">JRE</acronym>.
#+END_HTML 
Most systems already have it installed but if you don't have it you
can get it from [[http://www.java.com][Java.com]]. 

Just download the .jar file and run it like you would any app. You can
also run it from a terminal with this command:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
java -jar equations.jar
#+END_SRC

* How To Use
Enter any formulas and equations in the top text box and the results
will be displayed in the bottom text box as you type.
